    Next: write a quick test to check that directionality value is validated during parsing

    - use some sort of enum module for picklists; automatic validation!
    - use Class::Tiny everywhere
    - test that picklist values, etc. are checked during parsing
    - implement strict mode where problems like a bad date format or a language not listed in <languages> cause the program to croak, and lax mode where they do not
    - accept a DateTime object for date_created in Min.pm, instead of just a string
    - check input: no empty strings allowed.
    - check parsing success: catch errors
